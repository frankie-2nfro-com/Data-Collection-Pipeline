# Data-Collection-Pipeline
This repository is for my AiCore project for data collection. 

And this README is for the description of this project and answering the questions of the project milestones. 

## Milestone 1 - Decide the website you are going to collect data from
I am working with horse racing data for several years and still interesting in digging more 'useful knowledge' on this area. So I will try to collect data from a horse racing web site. I will try to learn again from AiCore and compare the method between mine and AiCore. And hope it will have some inspiration to improve my skill.

## Milestone 2 - Prototype finding the individual page for each entry

### Task 1 - Create a scraper class
